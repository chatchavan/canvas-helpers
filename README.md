# Canvas Helpers
A collection of Python scripts to help make Canvas more manageable

- [Bulk quiz result exporter](quiz-results-to-xlsx.py): When using Quizzes as assignments that need review or processing of some form, the "New Quizzes" feature on Canvas is far worse than the old version, and does not allow bulk response export. This script provides that missing feature. Usage: `python3 quiz-results-to-xlsx.py [assignment URL]`
